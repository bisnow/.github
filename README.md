# Description

This repository serves as a place to share configuration files and templates across all of the repositories within the [Bisnow organization](https://github.com/bisnow).

For now, it houses our [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/bisnow/.github/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) file so that we can use the same pull request template for PRs across all of our repositories.
